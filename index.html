      <h2>Academic & Technical Skills</h2>
      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both theory and practice. 
      I have solid command over <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong>, and I am particularly passionate about <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.</p>

      <p>I successfully completed an <strong>80-hour training on Python with Machine Learning</strong>, conducted by the Department of CSE at 
      <strong>Jagannath University</strong>, under the <strong>EDGE Project</strong> of the Bangladesh Computer Council, ICT Division 
      (May 2024 – February 2025).</p>

      <p>Additionally, I’ve built skills in <strong>web development</strong>—working on both front-end and back-end technologies. 
      Beyond academics, I continuously upgrade my knowledge through online courses and personal projects.</p>
